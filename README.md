- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Righteous. An inspiring cybersecurity enthusiast who shall change the world 1 c0de at a time.
- I enjoy breaking a system up into smaller components so I can learn the little intricacies that make a system what it is. Iâ€™m also interested in developing innovative websites and programs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
- ðŸ“« You can contact me through righteousonyedi@gmail.com  or at 0680022727.
- As an ambitious Information Technology student, I bring a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C#, HTML, CSS,  and Java. My expertise lies particularly in C# and web technologies (HTML and CSS). I have successfully applied these skills in various projects and coursework.

In addition to my technical abilities, I actively participate in industry events. I attended the annual hackathon hosted by Geekulcha on September 29, 2023, where I collaborated with fellow enthusiasts to solve real-world challenges. Recently, I also participated in the Security Summit hosted by IT WEB and Geekulcha on June 4, 2024, gaining insights into cybersecurity trends and best practices.

Furthermore, I am a proud member of the Geekulcha society at Northwest University (Vaal campus), where I engage with like-minded peers and stay updated on the latest developments in the IT field.

My passion for technology, combined with my practical experience and involvement in the community, makes me a dedicated and capable IT professional. I look forward to contributing my skills to impactful projects and organizations.
